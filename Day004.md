## **Blocky Maze Completion**

[Blocky maze](https://blockly-games.appspot.com/maze?lang=en&level=1&skin=0#mt55zw)

### 1.After you complete the 10th level, what is the JavaScript code you got? Cut and paste and assign it to the variable **level_10_code.**

### How many blocks did you have left? 

### Assign it to the variable **remaining_blocks.**



### SOURCE CODE:

```python
# Cut and paste the JavaScript code and assign it 
# to the variable below instructions
level_10_code = """while (notDone()) {
  if (isPathLeft()) {
    turnLeft();
  }
  if (isPathForward()) {
    moveForward();
  } else {
    turnRight();
  }
}"""
# Transfer the value from Level 10 "blocks remaining"
# to the variable below 

remaining_blocks = 4

print("JavaScript code for Level 10")
print(level_10_code)

print("Number of blocks remaining", remaining_blocks)
```



### OUTPUT:

```python
JavaScript code for Level 10
while (notDone()) {
  if (isPathLeft()) {
    turnLeft();
  }
  if (isPathForward()) {
    moveForward();
  } else {
    turnRight();
  }
}
Number of blocks remaining 4
```



### 2.If you adopted the "Follow the Left Wall" **algorithm**, you will complete Level 10.

### What is the JavaScript code you got? 

### Cut and paste and assign it to the variable **level_10_code.**

### How many blocks did you have left?

### Assign it to the variable **remaining_blocks.**


  ```PYTHON
# Cut and paste the JavaScript code and assign it 
# to the variable below 

level_10_code = """while (notDone()) {
  if (isPathLeft()) {
    turnLeft();
  }
  if (isPathForward()) {
    moveForward();
  } else {
    turnRight();
  }
}"""
# Transfer the value from Level 10 "blocks remaining"
# to the variable below 

remaining_blocks = 4

print("JavaScript code for Level 10")
print(level_10_code)

print("Number of blocks remaining", remaining_blocks)

  ```



### 3.If you adopted the "Follow the Right Wall" **algorithm**, you will complete Level 10.

### What is the JavaScript code you got? 

### Cut and paste and assign it to the variable **level_10_code.**

### How many blocks did you have left?

### Assign it to the variable **remaining_blocks.**

```python
# Cut and paste the JavaScript code and assign it 
# to the variable below 

level_10_code = """while (notDone()) {
  if (isPathRight()) {
    turnRight();
  }
  if (isPathForward()) {
    moveForward();
  } else {
    turnLeft();
  }
}"""
# Transfer the value from Level 10 "blocks remaining"
# to the variable below 

remaining_blocks = 4 

print("JavaScript code for Level 10")
print(level_10_code)
print("Number of blocks remaining", remaining_blocks)

```
