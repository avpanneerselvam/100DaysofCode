## 1.Given the integer N - the number of seconds that is passed since midnight - how many full hours and full minutes are passed since midnight?

 The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 1339).  

For example, if N = 3900, then 3900 seconds have passed since midnight. 

Therefore, the time now is **1:05am**. 

So the program should print **1 65** - 1 full hour is passed since midnight, 65 full minutes passed since midnight.



**EXAMPLE INPUT:**

```python
3900
```

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT:**

```python
1 65
```



#### SOURCE CODE:

```python
# Read an integer:
a = int(input())
hour=a//3600
minute=a//60
#minuteminute=minute0/60
# Print a value:
print(hour,minute)

# 0. Name your variables properly so that the name 
#    indicates what value they contain 
# 1. If you don't about snake_case, read about it 
#    at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case
# 2. Ask your mentor what "naming convention" means
# 3. Use a minimum of three variables and print using 
#    those variables 
```



## 2.Given two timestamps of the same day: a number of hours, minutes and seconds for both of the timestamps. The moment of the first timestamp happened before the moment of the second one. Calculate how many seconds passed between them.

**Example input #1**

```python
1
1
1
2
2
2

```

**Example output #1**

```python
3661
```



**Example input #2**

```python
1
2
30
1
3
20
```

**Example output #2**

```python
50
```



### SOURCE CODE:

```python
# Read an integer:
hour = int(input())
mins= int(input())
sec = int(input())

hour1 = int(input())
mins1= int(input())
sec1 = int(input())

hours=(hour1-hour)*3600
mins0=(mins1-mins)*60
secs=sec1-sec

seconds= hours+mins0+secs
print(seconds)
```
