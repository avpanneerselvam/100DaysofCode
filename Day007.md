## 1.) Distance between two points

Write a program to calculate the distance between two points.

To find the distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), all that you need to do is use the coordinates of these ordered pairs and apply some common sense. Begin with the most simplest formula and then incrementally arrive at the correct formula as you solve the test cases.

**1. Do it your own way**

Solve it the way using whatever technique works for you. 

**2. Do it incrementally  (remember Maze 10 in Blocky?)**

1. Look at the first test case - Point p1 = (0,0) and Point p2 =(4,0). If you mentally apply your mind, the answer is 4. Write the simple formula for this and past the test case.
2. Look at the second test case - Point p1 = (4,0) and Point p2 = (0,0). The answer should again be 4. But what does your code calculate the value to? What is the one simple **change** you will do to make it pass Test case 1 and Test case 2?
3. Now, move on to the next test case, and so on.  

### Example 

**INPUT **

```python
4
0
0

```

**OUTPUT**

```

```

**INPUT **

```

```

**OUTPUT**

```



### SOURCE CODE:

```
import math
# get the x coordinate of Point 1
x1 = int(input())  
# get the y coordinate of Point 1
y1 = int(input())  
# get the x coordinate of Point 2
x2 = int(input())
# get the y coordinate of Point 2
y2 = int(input())
# Write the code to calculate distance between 
# the two points 
distance = math.sqrt( ((x1-x2)**2)+((y1-y2)**2) )

print(distance)
```

## 2.)Given a three-digit number. Find the sum of its digits.

#### Example input

```
123
```

#### Example output

```
6
```

### SOURCE CODE:

```python
# Read an integer:
a = int(input())
# Print a value:
sum=0
while(a!=0):
  remin=a%10
  sum=sum+remin
  a=a//10
print(sum)
```
