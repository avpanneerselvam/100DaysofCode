# JugsMugsPugs Special

**SPECIAL REQUIREMENT:** 

Try and limit the number of **conditional statements to not more than two.** 

This requires some advanced Python language knowledge. *I don't expect everyone*  

*to be able to complete this.*

Write a program that receives **a number** on the input and prints values from 1 to that number subjected to the conditions below. 

It also should receive another value '**rev**' (either 0 or 1) on the input.   

For every number in the given range,   

\- If the number is a multiple of 3, or it contains digit 3, it prints "**Jugs**".   

\- If the number is a multiple of 5, or it contains digit 5, it prints "**Mugs**".  

\- If the number is a multiple of 7, or it contains digit 7, it prints "**Pugs**".  

\- If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "**JugsMugs**".        

  \- also if number contains 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs"  

\- If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "**JugsPugs**".        

  \- also if number contains 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs"  - If the number is a multiple of 3, 5 and 7, it prints "**JugsMugsPugs**".

â€‹       \- also if number contains 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs"

Otherwise, it prints the number.

 **REVERSE REQUIREMENT:**

If the boolean **'rev'** is **True (or 1)**, then reverse the order of printing.    

  \- "PugsJugsMugs" for multiples of 3, 5 and 7   

  \- "PugsMugs" for multiple of 3 and 7   

  \- "MugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 5    

  \- "PugsJugs" for multiple of 5 and 7
