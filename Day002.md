## 1.Write a program that greets the user by printing the word "Hello", a comma, the name of the user and an exclamation mark after it. See the examples below.

**Warning.** Your program's output should strictly match the desired one, character by character. There shouldn't be any space between the name and the exclamation mark. You can use + operator to concatenate two strings. See the lesson for details.

##### SOURCE CODE:

```python
# Read a string:
a = input()
# Print a string:
print("Hello,"+a+'!')
```



**EXAMPLE INPUT:**

```python
Harry
```

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT:**

```python
Hello, Harry!
```
